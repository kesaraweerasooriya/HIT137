This is Mahathir Md Taief (s383874). So, in this question, in Chapter1, I integrated the random number generation, RGB value finding and changing the RGB values of the image and save it in only one code. For better understanding, I have given you the code which I used to determine the pixel values separately. each time the code is run, it will generate a number, change the RGB values accordingly and save it in the name "chapter1out.png". In my case the output was 88. So I have provide the image according to my output. In chapter2, I wrote a code to decode the encoded text and found the correct shift key is 13. So, I modified the code and instead of trying all the shift keys, I use shift key 13 to be implemented so that the code remains clean. That's all from my side.
